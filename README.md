# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the IMDb movie reviews dataset.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/MridulGupta18/Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of a new movie review.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 88.6% on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques such as word embeddings or deep learning models.
- Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time sentiment analysis.
